# Deep-Learning-Architectures-RBM-DDN-and-DBN
This repository contains implementations of deep learning architectures, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), Deep Dense Networks (DDN), and Deep Belief Networks (DBN), using the MNIST dataset. All codes are written in PyTorch and implements the algorithms from scratch.
